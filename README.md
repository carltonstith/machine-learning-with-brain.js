# Machine Learning with Brain.js

These are very simple exercises that I'm using to learn brain.js and machine learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. A text editor
2. Node
3. Brain.js

```
npm install brain.js
```

## Deployment

```
console.log
```

## Built With

* [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) - Neural networks in JavaScript
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
